* Iedit - Edit multiple regions in the same way simultaneously

This package includes Emacs minor modes (iedit-mode and
iedit-rectangle-mode) based on a API library (iedit-lib) and allows you to edit
one occurrence of some text in a buffer (possibly narrowed) or region, and
simultaneously have other occurrences edited in the same way, with visual
feedback as you type.

Normal scenario of Iedit mode is like:

 - Highlight certain contents - by press C-;
   All occurrences of a symbol, string or a rectangle in the buffer or a region
   may be highlighted corresponding to current mark, point and prefix
   argument. Refer to the document of `iedit-mode' for details.

 - Edit one of the occurrences
   The change is applied to other occurrences simultaneously.

 - Finish - by pressing C-; again

You can also use Iedit mode as a quick way to temporarily show only the
buffer lines that match the current text being edited.  This gives you the
effect of a temporary `keep-lines' or `occur'.  To get this effect, hit C-'
when in Iedit mode - it toggles hiding non-matching lines.

Renaming refactoring is convinient in Iedit mode

 - The symbol under point is selected as occurrence by default and only complete
   symbols are matched

 - With digit prefix argument 0, only occurrences in current function are matched

 - Restricting symbols in current region can be done by pressing C-; again

 - Last renaming refactoring is remembered and can be applied to other buffers
   later

Iedit-rectangle-mode provides rectangle support with *visible rectangle*
highlighting, which is similar with cua mode rectangle support.  But it's
lighter weight and uses iedit mechanisms.

There are also some other facilities you may never think about.  Refer to the
document of function `iedit-mode' (C-h f iedit-mode RET) for more details.
