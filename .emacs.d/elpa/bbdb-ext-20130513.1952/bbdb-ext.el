;;  This file contains some extra commands for BBDB. Here is a list of the keybindings:

;; "g"    : Search address of current record on google maps
;; "S d"  : Show records with address field matching regexp (use "^$" to show records with no address)
;; "/ S"  : Show records that match regexp in either name, company, network, address or notes fields
;; "/ n"  : Show records with name field matching regexp
;; "/ c"  : Show records with company field matching regexp
;; "/ a"  : Show records with network address field matching regexp
;; "/ o"  : Show records with notes field matching regexp
;; "/ p"  : Show records with phones field matching regexp
;; "/ d"  : Show records with address field matching regexp (use "^$" to show records with no address)
;; "/ /"  : Show all records

;;; Commands:
;;
;; Below are complete command list:
;;
;;  `bbdb-google-map'
;;    Search REC's address field using Google Maps.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search'
;;    Display all entries in the *BBDB* buffer matching the REGEX in either the name(s), company, network address, or notes.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-name'
;;    Display all entries in the *BBDB* buffer matching the REGEX in the name (or ``alternate'' names) field.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-company'
;;    Display all entries in *BBDB* buffer matching REGEX in the company field.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-net'
;;    Display all entries in *BBDB* buffer matching regexp REGEX in the network address.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-notes'
;;    Display all entries in *BBDB* buffer matching REGEX in the named notes field.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-phones'
;;    Display all entries in *BBDB* buffer matching the REGEX in the phones field.
;;  `bbdb-recursive-search-address'
;;    Display all entries in the *BBDB* buffer matching the REGEX in the address fields.
;;  `bbdb-disable-all-limits'
;;    Display all entries in BBDB database.
;;  `bbdb-address'
;;    Display all entries in the BBDB matching the REGEX in the address field.
;;
;;; Customizable Options:
;;
;; Below are customizable option list:
;;


;;; Installation:
;;
;; Put bbdb-ext.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
;; You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
;; (add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
;; where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
;; (you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).
;;
;; Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.
;;
;; (require 'bbdb-ext)
