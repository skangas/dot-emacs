In a terminal in line mode the following substitutions are also performed
automatically:

       %f - expands to the currently selected file in the left pane
       %F - expands to the currently selected file in the right pane
       %m - expands to the list of paths of all marked files in the left pane

       %P - expands to the current directory in the passive pane
       %% - inserts a single % sign.
