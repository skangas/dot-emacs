;;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This code is inspired in part by erc-page-me.el and offers
;; the same functionality as it, but for rcirc.
;;
;;
;; * `my-rcirc-notify-message` contains the message contents for
;;    the notification
;;
;; * `my-rcirc-notify-message-private` contains the message
;;    contents for a private message notification
;;
;; * `my-rcirc-notify-nick-alist` is a list containing the last
;;    folks who notified you, and what times they did it at
;;
;; * `my-rcirc-notify-timeout` controls the number of seconds
;;    in between notifications from the same nick.
